### A collection of simple-yet-useful scripts I've made.

# Includes

* Drop weapon on death
* Third-person use animations with selection animations
* Silent kill command & server-side toggle
* Vanilla suicide disabler
* Knock function with server-side toggle & third-person animation
* Function to remove all default HL2 items & weapons from maps
* Easy to tweak options panel
* Editable basic Jump Pad entity
* Entity ID tool, for use in Lua

# How To Use

Use the handy options panel on the right side of the spawn menu, under [b]Options > V92 > Simple Useful Scripts[/b], or use the commands directly in the console.

* Use the "dropweapon" command to drop your weapon.
* Use your "use" key on objects to display an animation in third-person.
* Use the "killsilent" command to kill yourself without any death notices, sounds, or corpses.
* Use the "knock" command when close to a surface to emit a knock-knock sound.
* Use the "cleanupitems" command to cleanup all default map-spawned HL2 items or weapons.

# How To Bind Via Console
